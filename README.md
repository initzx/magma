# Magma

A Lavalink connector written in Python, translated from Fre_d's Java Lavalink client.
### Requirements:
* discord.py, rewrite (any other versions should work just fine)
* asyncio
* websockets
* aiohttp

**Magma depends on discord.py rewrite**

More info in requirements.txt

There is a very basic working example of a cog implementing Magma under examples which you can use for reference.
